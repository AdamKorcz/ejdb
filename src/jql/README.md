# JQL

EJDB query (JQL) syntax inpired by ideas behind XPath and Unix shell pipes.
It designed for easy querying and updating sets of JSON documents.

## JQL grammar

JQL parser created created by
[peg/leg â€” recursive-descent parser generators for C](http://piumarta.com/software/peg/) Here is the formal parser grammar: https://github.com/Softmotions/ejdb/blob/ejdb2/src/jql/jqp.leg

## Non formal JQL grammar adapted for brief overview

Notation used below is based on SQL syntax description:

Rule | Description
--- | ---
`' '` | String in single quotes denotes unquoted string literal as part of query.
<code>`{ a | b }`</code> | Curly brackets enclose two or more required alternative choices, separated by vertical bars.
<nobr>`[ ]`</nobr> | Square brackets indicate an optional element or clause. Multiple elements or clauses are separated by vertical bars.
<nobr>`|`</nobr> | Vertical bars separate two or more alternative syntax elements.
<nobr>`...`</nobr> |  Ellipses indicate that the preceding element can be repeated. The repetition is unlimited unless otherwise indicated.
<nobr>`( )`</nobr> | Parentheses are grouping symbols.
Unquoted word in lower case| Denotes semantic of some query part. For example: `placeholder_name` - name of any placeholder.
```
QUERY = FILTERS [ '|' APPLY ] [ '|' PROJECTIONS ] [ '|' OPTS ];

STR = { quoted_string | unquoted_string };

JSONVAL = json_value;

PLACEHOLDER = { ':'placeholder_name | '?' }

FILTERS = FILTER [{ and | or } [ not ] FILTER];

  FILTER = [@collection_name]/NODE[/NODE]...;

  NODE = { '*' | '**' | NODE_EXPRESSION | STR };

  NODE_EXPRESSION = '[' NODE_EXPR_LEFT OP NODE_EXPR_RIGHT ']'
                        [{ and | or } [ not ] NODE_EXPRESSION]...;

  OP =   [ '!' ] { '=' | '>=' | '<=' | '>' | '<' }
      | [ '!' ] { 'eq' | 'gte' | 'lte' | 'gt' | 'lt' }
      | [ not ] { 'in' | 'ni' | 're' };

  NODE_EXPR_LEFT = { '*' | '**' | STR | NODE_KEY_EXPR };

  NODE_KEY_EXPR = '[' '*' OP NODE_EXPR_RIGHT ']'

  NODE_EXPR_RIGHT =  JSONVAL | STR | PLACEHOLDER

APPLY = 'apply' { PLACEHOLDER | json_object | json_array  } | 'del'

OPTS = { 'skip' n | 'limit' n | 'count' | 'noidx' | ORDERBY }...

  ORDERBY = { 'asc' | 'desc' } PLACEHOLDER | json_path

PROJECTIONS = PROJECTION [ {'+' | '-'} PROJECTION ]

  PROJECTION = 'all' | json_path

```

* `json_value`: Any valid JSON value: object, array, string, bool, number.
* `json_path`: Simplified JSON pointer. Eg.: `/foo/bar` or `/foo/"bar with spaces"/`
* `*` in context of `NODE`: Any JSON object key name at particular nesting level.
* `**` in context of `NODE`: Any JSON object key name at arbitrary nesting level.
* `*` in context of `NODE_EXPR_LEFT`: Key name at specific level.
* `**` in context of `NODE_EXPR_LEFT`: Nested array value of array element under specific key.

## JQL quick introduction

Lets play with some very basic data and queries.
For simplicity we will use ejdb websocket network API which provides us a kind of interactive CLI. The same job can be done using pure `C` API too (`ejdb2.h jql.h`).

NOTE: Take a look into [JQL test cases](./tests/jql_test1.c) for more examples.

```json
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "age": 28,
  "pets": [
    {"name": "Rexy rex", "kind": "dog", "likes": ["bones", "jumping", "toys"]},
    {"name": "Grenny", "kind": "parrot", "likes": ["green color", "night", "toys"]}
  ]
}
```
Save json as `sample.json` then upload it the `family` collection:

```sh
# Start HTTP/WS server protected by some access token
./jbs -a 'myaccess01'
8 Mar 16:15:58.601 INFO: HTTP/WS endpoint at localhost:9191
```

Server can be accessed using HTTP or Websocket endpoint. [More info](../jbr/README.md)

```sh
curl -d '@sample.json' -H'X-Access-Token:myaccess01' -X POST http://localhost:9191/family
```

We can play around using interactive [wscat](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@softmotions/wscat) websocket client.

```sh
wscat  -H 'X-Access-Token:myaccess01' -q -c http://localhost:9191
connected (press CTRL+C to quit)
> k info
< k     {
 "version": "2.0.0",
 "file": "db.jb",
 "size": 8192,
 "collections": [
  {
   "name": "family",
   "dbid": 3,
   "rnum": 1,
   "indexes": []
  }
 ]
}

> k get family 1
< k     1       {
 "firstName": "John",
 "lastName": "Doe",
 "age": 28,
 "pets": [
  {
   "name": "Rexy rex",
   "kind": "dog",
   "likes": [
    "bones",
    "jumping",
    "toys"
   ]
  },
  {
   "name": "Grenny",
   "kind": "parrot",
   "likes": [
    "green color",
    "night",
    "toys"
   ]
  }
 ]
}
```

Note about the `k` prefix before every command; It is an arbitrary key choosen by client and designated to identify particular websocket request, this key will be returned with response to request and allows client to identify that response for his particular request. [More info](../jbr/README.md)

Query command over websocket has the following format:

```
<key> query <collection> <query>
```

So we will consider only `<query>` part in this document.

### Get all elements in collection
```
k query family /*
```
or
```
k query family /**
```
or specify collection name in query explicitly
```
k @family/*
```

We can execute query by HTTP `POST` request
```
curl --data-raw '@family/[firstName=John]' -H'X-Access-Token:myaccess01' -X POST http://localhost:9191

1	{"firstName":"John","lastName":"Doe","age":28,"pets":[{"name":"Rexy rex","kind":"dog","likes":["bones","jumping","toys"]},{"name":"Grenny","kind":"parrot","likes":["green color","night","toys"]}]}
```

### Set the maximum number of elements in result set

```
k @family/* | limit 10
```

### Get documents where specified json path exists

Element at index `1` exists in `likes` array within a `pets` sub-object
```
> k query family /pets/*/likes/1
< k     1       {"firstName":"John"...
```

Element at index `1` exists in `likes` array at any `likes` nesting level
```
> k query family /**/likes/1
< k     1       {"firstName":"John"...
```

**From this point and below I will omit websocket specific prefix `k query family` and
consider only JQL queries.**

### Matching JSON entry values

Below is a set of self explaining queries:

```
/pets/*/[name = "Rexy rex"]

/pets/*/[name eq "Rexy rex"]

/pets/*/[name = "Rexy rex" or name = Grenny]
```
Note about quotes around words with spaces.

Get all documents where owner `age` greater than `20` and have some pet who like `bones` or `toys`
```
/[age > 20] and /pets/*/likes/[** in ["bones", "toys"]]
```
Here `**` denotes some element in `likes` array.

`ni` is the inverse operator to `in`.
Get documents where `bones` somewhere in `likes` array.
```
/pets/*/[likes ni "bones"]
```

We can create more complicated filters
```
( /[age <= 20] or /[lastName re "Do.*"] )
  and /pets/*/likes/[** in ["bones", "toys"]]
```
Note about grouping parentheses and regular expression matching using `re` operator.

### Arrays and maps can be matched as is

Filter documents with `likes` array exactly matched to `["bones","jumping","toys"]`
```
/**/[likes = ["bones","jumping","toys"]]
```
Matching algorithms for arrays and maps are different:

* Array elements are fully matched from start to end. In equal arrays
  all values at the same index should be equal.
* Object maps matching consists of the following steps:
  * Lexicographically sort object keys in both maps.
  * Do matching keys and its values starting from the lowest key.
  * If all corresponding keys and values in one map are fully matched to ones in other
    and vice versa, maps considered to be equal.
    For example: `{"f":"d","e":"j"}` and `{"e":"j","f":"d"}` are equal maps.

### Conditions on key names

Find JSON document having `firstName` key at root level.
```
/[* = "firstName"]
```
I this context `*` denotes a key name.

You can use conditions on key name and key value at the same time:
```
/[[* = "firstName"] = John]
```

Key name can be either `firstName` or `lastName` but should have `John` value in any case.
```
/[[* in ["firstName", "lastName"]] = John]
```

It may be useful in queries with dynamic placeholders (C API):
```
/[[* = :keyName] = :keyValue]
```

## JQL Updating and deleting documents

`APPLY` section responsible for modification of documents content.

```
APPLY = ('apply' { PLACEHOLDER | json_object | json_array  }) | 'del'
```

JSON patch specs conformed to `rfc7386` or `rfc6902` specifications followed after `apply` keyword.

Let's add `address` object to all matched document
```
/[firstName=John] | apply {"address":{"city":"New York", "street":""}}
```

If JSON object is an argument of `apply` section it will be treated as merge match (`rfc7386`) otherwise it should be array which denotes `rfc6902` JSON patch. Placegolders also supported by `apply` section.
```
/* | apply :?
```

Set the street name in `address`
```
/[firstName=John] | apply [{"op":"replace", "path":"/address/street", "value":"Fifth Avenue"}]
```

Use `del` keyword to remove matched elements from collection:
```
/FILTERS | del
```

Example:
```
> k add family {"firstName":"Jack"}
< k     2
> k query family /[firstName re "Ja.*"]
< k     2       {"firstName":"Jack"}

# Remove selected elements from collection
> k query family /[firstName=Jack] | del
< k     2       {"firstName":"Jack"}
```
